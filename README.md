# TapOnIt - Frontend Tech Evaluation

## Description
This repository is a collection of codes and files showcasing my skills and approach to the frontend development for TapOnIt's evaluation process. The application displays a visually appealing list of coupons that can be redeemed by users. The users can also be able to search coupons for a specific store or brand.   

The app includes a frontend application built using technologies such as Nuxt, TailwindCSS, and FontAwesome. It also demonstrates the implementation of authentication, where the content is gated until a user signs in, using AWS Amplify Authentication.
